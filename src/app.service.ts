import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

@Injectable()
export class AppService {}

/*
    Description. This short piece of code defines a service class built with NestJS. The purpose and function of the code is as follows:
    1. `@Injectable()` Decorator: This decorator indicates that the `AppService` class is a service. NestJS uses this decorator to inject the class into the dependency injection system. This makes the class available to other classes.

    2. `AppService` Class: This class is currently empty and does not contain any methods or properties. However, in the future, it may contain the business logic of your application. Services are usually used for functions such as data processing, database operations, or external API calls.
    Full code:
    ```typescript
    import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

    @Injectable()
    export class AppService {}
    ```
    Summary
    - `@Injectable()` Decorator: Indicates that the `AppService` class is a service and will be managed by the NestJS dependency injection system.
    - `AppService` Class: Currently empty, but may come to contain the business logic of the application in the future.
    This service can be injected and used by other components. For example, a controller can use this service to fulfil certain business logic.
